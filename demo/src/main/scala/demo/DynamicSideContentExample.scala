    "103.1. At the start of a game, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In " +
      "the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method " +
      "(flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game " +
      "chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game" +
      " makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The game’s " +
      "default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise."

    "103.4. Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some " +
      "effects can modify a player’s starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may " +
      "take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player " +
      "in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take " +
      "mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their " +
      "library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal " +
      "to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. Once a " +
      "player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player’s opening hand, and that player " +
      "may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A player" +
      " can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further" +
      " mulligans."
